    title: About iamai-core
    subtitle: Personal AI, Simply Yours
    text: |
      iamai-core is a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence: a personal AI system
      that learns continuously from its user, operates entirely locally, and can serve as both
      a companion and a legacy. Our technology is designed to be scalable while remaining
      accessible to users with varying levels of computing resources.

      ## Our Story

      In the world of local AI, there is a stark divide: powerful tools for developers that require
      technical expertise, or simple website apps for everyone else that lack real capability.
      iamai-core bridges this gap by being both a straightforward personal AI application and a
      set of easy-to-use developer plugins.

      What makes iamai-core different is its approach. It runs entirely on your own device, learning
      from your daily interactions while keeping everything private. No cloud services, no data sharing,
      no complex setup - just download and start. For regular users, it's as easy as installing any
      other program. For developers, it's a powerful framework that integrates smoothly into existing projects.

      Think of it like having a digital companion that evolves alongside you. It learns from each interaction,
      becoming more personalized over time. It's your AI, running on your hardware, adapting to your
      preferences, completely private.

      We believe personal AI should be accessible to everyone - powerful for developers, simple for
      everyone else. That's why we're building iamai-core as an open-source project, creating a foundation
      for truly personal artificial intelligence that anyone can use and build upon.

      ## Core Architecture

      Our technology consists of three main components:

      1. **Core neural network ("brain")** - The central AI model that powers understanding and generation

      2. **Data modality I/O systems ("senses")** - Interfaces for text, audio, and visual interaction

      3. **Traditional programming interfaces ("tools")** - Extensions for practical functionality

      All of this runs locally with no cloud dependencies, preserving your privacy and ownership of your data.

      ## About the Founder

      ![Wil Bown, Founder](\images\Wil-majestic-portrait-bw-300x300.jpg)

      **Wil Bown** is the founder and lead software architect of iamai-core. With extensive experience
      in artificial intelligence and software development, Wil founded iamai-core with a vision to make
      powerful AI accessible to everyone while preserving privacy and personal control.

      Wil believes that the future of AI is not in massive cloud services owned by corporations, but in
      personal AI systems that learn from and grow with their individual users. His goal with iamai-core
      is to create technology that empowers people rather than exploiting them - AI that truly belongs to
      its users.

      As the project lead, Wil oversees the technical architecture and vision of iamai-core, working to
      bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and practical everyday applications that respect
      user privacy and ownership.
