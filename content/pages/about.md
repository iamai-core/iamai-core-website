    title: About iamai-core
    subtitle: Personal AI, Simply Yours
    text: |
      iamai-core is a revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence: a personal AI system
      that learns continuously from its user, operates entirely locally, and can serve as both
      a companion and a legacy. Our technology is designed to be scalable while remaining
      accessible to users with varying levels of computing resources.

      ## Our Story

      In the world of local AI, there is a stark divide: powerful tools for developers that require
      technical expertise, or simple website apps for everyone else that lack real capability.
      iamai-core bridges this gap by being both a straightforward personal AI application and a
      set of easy-to-use developer plugins.

      What makes iamai-core different is its approach. It runs entirely on your own device, learning
      from your daily interactions while keeping everything private. No cloud services, no data sharing,
      no complex setup - just download and start. For regular users, it's as easy as installing any
      other program. For developers, it's a powerful framework that integrates smoothly into existing projects.

      Think of it like having a digital companion that evolves alongside you. It learns from each interaction,
      becoming more personalized over time. It's your AI, running on your hardware, adapting to your
      preferences, completely private.

      We believe personal AI should be accessible to everyone - powerful for developers, simple for
      everyone else. That's why we're building iamai-core as an open-source project, creating a foundation
      for truly personal artificial intelligence that anyone can use and build upon.

      ## Core Architecture

      Our technology consists of three main components:

      1. **Core neural network ("brain")** - The central AI model that powers understanding and generation

      2. **Data modality I/O systems ("senses")** - Interfaces for text, audio, and visual interaction

      3. **Traditional programming interfaces ("tools")** - Extensions for practical functionality

      All of this runs locally with no cloud dependencies, preserving your privacy and ownership of your data.

      ## About the Founder

      ![Wil Bown, Founder](/images/Wil-majestic-portrait-bw-300x300.jpg)

      **Wil Bown** is the founder and lead architect of iamai-core, bringing over 35 years of innovative
      development experience to the project. As a specialist in AI architectures (Transformer, RL, GAN, LSTM,
      etc) with expertise in llama.cpp, PyTorch, and TensorFlow, Wil has consistently pioneered at the
      intersection of emerging technologies. His background includes creating one of the first viable
      Blockchain + AI projects (Neureal), implementing reinforcement learning AI agents, and building
      open-source frameworks for AI experimentation.

      Wil's technical vision is complemented by his community leadership, having founded and grown Utah's
      largest Bitcoin and VR meetup communities. His passion for "making machines that give us the power to
      be more human" drives iamai-core's mission of creating AI that truly belongs to its users â€” technology
      that runs locally, preserves privacy, and learns continually from personal interaction rather than
      corporate data collection.

      With award-winning projects in AI, blockchain, and VR, Wil bridges cutting-edge technological
      capabilities with practical applications that respect user agency and ownership.
